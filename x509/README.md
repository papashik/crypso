# Important Notice

This is a fork of the `crypto/x509` Go package, adding `MLDSA-65` algorithm support. The original source can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/golang/go), [x509](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/crypto/x509).

Be careful about making local modifications to this code as it will
make maintenance harder in future.
